# Who I am?

Hello, I am Lili Zhao Mallina.  I am a self-taught programmer and data analyst.  I learned coding from Khan Academy to help my child with his homework.  Lo and behold,
I fell in love with coding.  It was the first time I combined creativity, critical thinking, and persistent learning.  Each project that I worked on presented new
challenges and forces me to learn new things.  After growing out of Khan Academy, I learned from freecodecamp, John Smilga, and coursera.  Last month, I earned my Google
Data Analytic certification.  Currently, I am enrolled in the Meta Frontend certificate in coursera.
